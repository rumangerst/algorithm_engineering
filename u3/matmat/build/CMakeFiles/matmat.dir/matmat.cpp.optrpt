Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.

Begin optimization report for: matmat(double, bool, const double *, int, int, int, const double *, int, int, double, double *, int)
