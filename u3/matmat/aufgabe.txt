Performance:

1,000,000 iterations

        No vectorization    Vectorization
Host    0.12899s            0.148285s
Phi     2.20162s            1.46716s

On the host there is almost no difference, while the runtime
is almost half with vectorization.

Explanation:

The vectorization leads to different est. speedups for host and coprocessor:

Speedup (32,7) #1   (32,7) #2
Host    2.910       3.780
Phi     3.670       4.610

2. 

I would expect an increase of performance for both processors as
there is no operation C*ß and no additition with α*A*B (also one read operation less due to C does not need to be read, only written).

The Xeon Phi have a special function to handle intrinsic operations.
In the matrix multiplication step, C[...] += alpha * [...] can be 
calculated by Xeon Phi more efficiently.
